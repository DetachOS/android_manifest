# DetachOS

 Getting Started
---------------
To get started with the DetachOS sources, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/setup/build/downloading).

To initialize your local repository, use command:

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/DetachOS/android_manifest.git -b detach-11.0
```

Then sync up:

```bash
repo sync
```
